Seat B has the highest degree centrality, suggesting it has the most direct connections. Seat B might be beneficial if you want to be a key connector or bridge within the network since it has the highest betweenness centrality.Being in a seat that is central to many interactions can lead to frequent interruptions, making it difficult to read, think, or relax.

```{r}
# Create a layout 
layout <- layout_nicely(bus_network)

# Plot the network
plot(bus_network, layout = layout, 
     vertex.label = V(bus_network)$name, # Label nodes with their names
     vertex.size = degree_centrality * 50, # Adjust vertex size based on degree centrality for visualization
     main = "Bus Network Graph with Centrality Measures")

# Adding centrality values as labels next to the nodes
text(layout, labels = paste("D:", round(degree_centrality, 2), "\nC:", round(closeness_centrality, 2), "\nB:", round(betweenness_centrality, 2)), pos = 4, cex = 0.8)
